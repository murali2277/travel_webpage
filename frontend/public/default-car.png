This should be a default car image (PNG format) that will be displayed when vehicle images are not available.

You can:
1. Download a free car icon/image from sites like:
   - Flaticon.com
   - Icons8.com
   - Freepik.com
2. Save it as "default-car.png" in the frontend/public/ directory
3. Make sure it's a reasonable size (around 400x300 pixels)

The image will be used as a fallback when vehicle.image_url is null or the image fails to load.
